        <h2>Balance of the card </h2>
        <div>To read the balance it is necessary that you have a cell phone with NFC, if the application shows "The device does not have NFC technology"
             means that your device does not have this functionality to check the balance.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>If the device has NFC must be activated and then place the card on the back of the phone to show you the balance, we recommend
             remove the cell phone liner (if applicable) and locate the card <b> "Tu Llave" </b> on the back of it,
             in that moment you should slide it gently until it sounds to read it, if you do not read it, move it slowly until it can work,
             The reason is that some cell phones have the NFC located in different parts of the device.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div><b>The device has NFC but it does not read the card.</b>
            There are several factors that affect the reading of the balance of the card, for example, some devices have the NFC in the cell phone case,
             others have it on the battery and others internally. Make changes to the operating system by an unofficial version, changes of cover or changes
             can affect the operation of the NFC if they are not original spare parts from the manufacturer.
